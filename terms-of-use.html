                    <p>The current Indicative Eligibility Criteria for an Issuer is available for viewing on the
                        Website. The Indicative Eligibility Criteria is not exhaustive and Fundvistax may impose
                        additional requirements via any agreement entered into between Fundvistax and Issuer. Compliance
                        with the Indicative Eligibility Criteria may not of itself ensure the suitability of the Deal
                        for listing on the Website. Prospective Issuers, and in particular new issuers, are therefore
                        encouraged to contact Fundvistax or submit an Application to seek informal and confidential
                        guidance as to the eligibility of a proposed Deal for listing at the earliest possible
                        opportunity. At the time of reviewing an Application, Fundvistax may assess if the Issuer or
                        Issuer Obligors fulfill the Indicative Eligibility Criteria either alone or in combination.
                        Fundvistax may approve applications for listing the Deal on the Website unconditionally or subject
                        to condition(s), or may reject applications for listing, as it thinks appropriate. Fundvistax also
                        reserves the right to vary any such condition(s) or impose additional conditions. While the size
                        of an Issuer is important, greater emphasis is placed on factors such as the integrity of the
                        management and controlling shareholders, an Issuer’s relative stability, its reputation and the
                        quality of the Deal set out in the Application submitted by the Issuer; Fundvistax has absolute
                        discretion at any time to (i) modify the Indicative Eligibility Criteria; (ii) consider all
                        relevant circumstances in determining whether a Issuer satisfies the Indicative Eligibility
                        Criteria in respect of a Deal project and (iii) waive compliance with all or any requirements
                        mentioned in the Indicative Eligibility Criteria.</p>

                    <h2 class="css-1jzhx1m e5t2qy80">32. FORKS</h2>
                    <p>Software protocols governing a Digital Asset can experience sudden changes in operating rules
                        that are outside Fundvistax’s control (each change being a <strong> “Fork”</strong>). A Fork can
                        have a material change on the operation, functionality, value or even name of a Digital Asset.
                        If a Fork occurs, it may result in the creation of a new Digital Asset (<strong>“New
                            Asset”</strong>) which is related to an existing Digital Asset (<strong>“Previous
                            Asset”</strong>). Therefore, Forks may result in multiple versions of a Digital Asset and
                        each version could have a very different, and possibly lower, value than before the Fork.</p>
                    <p>If a Fork occurs, each User understands, acknowledges and agrees that Fundvistax may temporarily
                        suspend the operations of the Fundvistax Platform while Fundvistax determines, in its sole and
                        absolute discretion, whether to support the New Asset, the Previous Asset, or both, and Fundvistax
                        shall have the right to continue such suspension for such length of time as Fundvistax deems
                        necessary to make such a determination.</p>
                    <p>Fundvistax may, in its sole and absolute discretion: (a) obtain and retain the New Asset as
                        Fundvistax’s own property; or (b) recall and burn Previous Assets and make the New Assets
                        available to Users according to each User’s corresponding holdings of the Previous Asset at the
                        time of the Fork, subject to the withholding and retention of reasonable compensation by
                        Fundvistax for the cost of making the New Assets available to Users (at Fundvistax’s sole and
                        absolute determination). For the avoidance of doubt, Users have no right to any New Asset.</p>&nbsp;<p>
                        Each User agrees that Fundvistax is not responsible or liable to any User and any User shall hold
                        Fundvistax harmless in respect of any losses or damages (including lost profits) which may occur
                        as the result of a change in the underlying software protocol of a Digital Asset, a Fork,
                        Fundvistax’s determination to support or not support any particular Fork or modified software
                        protocol, and any suspension to the Fundvistax Platform while Fundvistax makes such determination.
